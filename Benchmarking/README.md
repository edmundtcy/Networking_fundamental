## A simple benchmarking python program to calculate the transfer speed and RTT of TCP and UDP connection between server and client

To run the program as a server, execute the program without any arguments:
```
 python3 netbench.py
```

To run the program as a client, execute the program with one argument, which gives the 
hostname or IP address of the server process:
```
python3 netbench.py localhost
```
